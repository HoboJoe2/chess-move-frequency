This is a python program to generate move frequency graphs from a pgn file.

The images in this repository were generated using the Lichess elite database from November 2020.

To use this program, follow these steps:
(These steps are meant for someone without much knowledge of computers, if you know what you're doing
you can do whatever you feel like)

1. Download python from python.org
2. Clone the repository by clicking the clone button on github
3. Open file explorer to where you just cloned the repository
4. Put your pgn file in the folder and call it "pgn_file.pgn" (The name has to be that or the code won't work)
5. Copy the location of the folder by clicking the bar above the files and using Ctrl + C
(should be something similar to "C:/This PC/Documents/chess-move-frequency" depending on where you cloned the repository to)
6. Open command prompt and type "cd " then paste the location (Eg. "cd C:/This PC/Documents/chess-move-frequency")
7. Type "pip install -r requirements.txt" and wait until it finishes
8. Close the command prompt
9. Run main.py

Hopefully that works, if it doesn't maybe just
